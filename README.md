# Pufferfish-Commando

A giant shipment of weapons from around the world was shipwrecked while crossing the pacific, scattering the weaponry across the ocean floor, making the fight for survival in those ecosystems a little more sophisticated.

The game is an endless 3D runner game where the user is a stationary pufferfish that rotates in 3 dimensions. Your goal as the Pufferfish Commando is to last as long as possible before the enemies of the deep reach him. The enemies come in waves that increase in difficulty as the waves are completed. As you progress through the game new weapons and armour is unlocked to equip your pufferfish with. Each armour piece or weapon is situated on a part of the pufferfish, so depending on their advantages and ranges, the user must gyroscopically rotate the pufferfish to attack and defend against enemies. Weapons are automatically triggered to attack enemies when they enter their hit boxes, and some defences even have enemy position tracking capabilities.

When each round starts a running point counter begins whose amount is based on kills and combos completed by the player, as well as elapsed time. Every time the user dies and restarts, the enemy algorithm restarts as does the level. Once certain tiers are reached for the first time, armour slots or “pents” will unlock for purchase in the storefront. Once an item is bought, it is owned by the player forever, to be equipped or unequipped at their will. Users must make their armour practical, as there are limited number of spaces, and different types of pents are needed for different purposes.

The choice of pentagon for the armour slot shape is to allow for a wide array of slot positions and possible configurations, without making the setup to long and complicated. 12 pentagons make up a regular dodecahedron, so leaving a hole for the pufferfish’s face, tail, and two fins, the armour will be made up of 8 possible pent positions, each capable of holding a weapon when unlocked. The player starts with the default configuration of 4 pents unlocked, and they unlock the shell with all 8 pents after reaching a certain level.
